					This website is currently under construction.  In short, we are building a cooler version of Threadless, and we promise to never sell out for the almighty buck.  Check back in a couple weeks for our soft launch, which will also include our <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/uberhipsters/" target="_blank">subreddit</a> that we hope will develop into a robust community of contributors.  Let's make some hilarious shit together.  In the meantime:
